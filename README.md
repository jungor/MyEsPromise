# MyEsPromise

My implementation of [ES6 Spec](https://www.baidu.com/link?url=pb-ecoL6zfCrXyES2992cc_jwvSvFdk9lvM6fjQkU7f296_OFYd55KUl5atoR1g79wDFUn1fWl6TWmO-0dGp1_&wd=&eqid=fd6dad56001103b1000000065e775928) Promise. It is also [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/) compliant.(Because ES6 Spec itself is Promises/A+ compliant)

## run Promises/A+ compliance tests

```sh
yarn && yarn test
```

## notes

Do not use in production. Just my personal learning of the underlying mechanism of Promise.
