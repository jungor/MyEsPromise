# MyEsPromise

My implementation of [ES6 Spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) Promise. It is also [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/) compliant.(Because ES6 Spec itself is Promises/A+ compliant)

## run Promises/A+ compliance tests

```sh
yarn && yarn test
```

## notes

Do not use in production. Just my personal learning of the underlying mechanism of Promise.
